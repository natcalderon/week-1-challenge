To refactor this code, I started by fixing any broken links. After that I added comments throughout both .css and .html pages to better understand where everything was. To consolidate the css selectors, I created classes that would represent a group versus just a section. Then I followed semantic stracuture by adding accessability elements. Finally I organized the css elements to fit in their own commented section.
